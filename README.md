# Roadmap <Trave/Scrum> Hackathon

Traveler well-being: the magic of taking a trip before you take it - or leave it!

Traveling for work is emotion and reality. Corporate travel policies are excel and fiction. How does a business traveler experience that their well-being is considered?

A business traveler needs to be willing to travel. Information on country safety, commuting responsibly, health-care & support in case of emergency, and cleanliness of the hotel, facilitate healthy decision making.

The challenge is that currently and post COVID-19, there are no user-friendly resources to comprehend and create a wholesome business travel plan based on the situation of the destination.

Roadhack will build a mobile solution that provides travelers with accurate advice for their destination based on the companyâ€™s travel policy, country, and health (DoC) information.

Roadhack calls this: the magic of taking a trip before you book, or take it. A destination-based solution translating the travel policy to traveler reality and well-being, to get the industry back on its feet and travelers in the air again.
